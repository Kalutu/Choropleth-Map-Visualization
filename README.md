# Choropleth Map Visualization
This web application displays a choropleth map of the United States, representing the percentage of adults age 25 and older with a bachelor's degree or higher. The map utilizes D3.js and TopoJSON to visualize the data.

The choropleth map displays county-level education data, where each county is colored based on the percentage of people with a bachelor's degree or higher.
